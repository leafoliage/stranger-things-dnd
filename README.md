# STDnD

This game is a midterm project from my DSOOP class (詹力韋 Prof. Liwei Chan). The project is to make a Dungeon game (or any kind of game) using oop in cpp, so I made this ST fangame. 

The story is set in Hawkins, Indiana in a parallel universe (so the setting would be slightly different from the ST series universe); players are requested to find a lost girl and fight back creatures from the Upside Down.
